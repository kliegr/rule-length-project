But if we are to examine the provided information more closely for the sake of giving an answer that is more than simple logic, Jenny is said to have been deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, so it is reasonable to think that she is more likely to be active in the feminist movement than not. Feminism is a movement that deals with inequality relating to gender, with a focus on discrimination against women. It would make sense that someone deeply concerned with issues of discrimination as a student would carry their views with  them into their adult life.

On top of this, Jenny is described as ""outspoken"" and ""very bright."" Thus, it would be more probable that Jenny not only thinks about, and seeks out more information on issues of social justice and discrimination, but is also open to discussion surrounding these issues and making her opinions and beliefs known to others. Being as she is stated to have participated in activism before (anti-nuclear demonstrations) it would not be unlikely that she would participate in activism relating to other issues.

There is also the added fact that Jenny, referred to as ""she,"" was either born biologically female, or self-identifies as female. This also makes her more likely to identify with discrimination against women and more likely to be an active feminist.

This additional information decreases the likelihood that Jenny is a bank teller who is NOT active in the feminist movement.",jenny_is_a_bank_teller,,,z,s
