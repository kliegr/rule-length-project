It is, however, also important to consider the biographical information to see if that contradicts this position. She is probably over educated to be a bank teller, and although it was likely she was active in the feminist movement as a student, most people  drop those sort of activities when they leave college.

Seeing as Jenny was very active among other things, in social movements and discrimination issues  as a student and was outspoken.  I would find it hard to believe that she would not take interest in issues which negatively affected females  and which did give women the freedoms and rights which their male counterparts also maintained.  She may not have been an active member of a feminist movement, but the description given of Jenny does not provide anything which would suggest that she would not be part of the feminist movement.  Based on her activities, the probability seems higher that she may have been involved in the feminist movement.

The last option, Jenny is a bank teller, could be absolutely true.  Jenny's description states that she is bright and would in all probability be suited and perhaps even overqualified for this type of job.  I did not select this statement as it was somewhat limited when compared with the other responses.  It was a very logical choice.

The first option was the response which I selected as firstly, being a cashier in a bank is a position in a bank which I think may give the individual a bit more responsibility than a bank teller.  As such, as the description of Jenny stated that she was very bright it is likely that she would have a position in a bank which would be a bit more advanced than a bank teller which was the third option.  The second part of this response, it is not known if she is active in the feminist movement, does not fully discard the possibility that she is part of the feminist movement as is stated in the second response.  Based on her past activities, her social movement issues and her feelings toward discrimination, it could be that she is part of a feminist movement.  She also may not be an active member. This statement does not offer a definitive answer to whether Jenny is an active in the movement.  What it does is allows for Jenny's past, the description provided of her personality and philosophy background to suggest that she could be the type of person who would be part of the feminist movement without fully discarding the possibility.  As such, based on the intelligence which Jenny may have, I would think she might have a higher chance of working in a position which requires a bit more responsibility.  Based on Jenny's outspokeness, her background in philosophy and her activities and beliefs while a student, I believe there is enough evidence to suggest that she could/could not be an active party in a feminist movement based on her choice rather than just discount the entire argument and definitively state that 'no' she is not part of the movement.",jenny_works_as_a_cashier_in_a_bank_and_it_is_not_known_if_she_is_active_in_feminist_movement,,,z,s
